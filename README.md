FRT-2023 Project:
Facebook Login is a fast and convenient way for people to create accounts and log into your app across multiple platforms. It's available on iOS, Android, Web, desktop apps and devices such as Smart TVs and Internet of Things objects. Facebook Login enables two scenarios, authentication and asking for permissions to access people's data. We can use Facebook Login simply for authentication or for both authentication and data access.

The onboarding experience is one of the most important user experiences in your app. A high quality onboarding experience can lead to conversion rates above 90% and encourages people to become more engaged and profitable.

Facebook Login lets people start using your app quickly and easily, and enjoy more personalized and meaningful experiences. In this doc, we offer tips and considerations to create a great login user experience with Facebook Login.
